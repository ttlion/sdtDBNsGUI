# Website description 

This website contains explains how to use the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the sdtDBN program.

# sdtDBN program

sdtDBN is a program developed to learn Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) with both static and dynamic features/attribues, allowing the user to make inference on the learned DBNs. All background related to sdtDBNs can be checked in the sdtDBN website, available at [https://ttlion.github.io/sdtDBN/](https://ttlion.github.io/sdtDBN/). The GUI presented in this website is an interface for a user to be able to use the sdtDBN program capabilities in a graphical way.

# Current releases and libraries

## Current releases

The GUI was developed using Python, being all source files available [here](sources_sdtDBNsGUI.zip), with the respective Github repository available [here](https://github.com/ttlion/sdtDBNsGUI_code).

For a user to be able to run the program without having to resort to the Python programming language, there are available executable standalone versions of the program, for Windows and for Linux, both in version 0.0.1: 

- [Windows executable v.0.0.1](sdtDBN_GUI_windows.zip)
- [Linux executable v.0.0.1](sdtDBN_GUI_Linux.zip)

These executable versions were created, from the Python source code, using [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/).

## External libraries

To generate images for the sdtDBNs, the GUI uses the DOT language. Therefore, if the user wants to use the GUI to create graphical representations of the created sdtDBNs (more details [here](#how-to-use-the-sdtdbn-gui-program)), Graphviz must be installed in the proper Operating System. Check [here](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) for more details on how to install Graphviz.

The program, written in Python, uses several Python libraries/modules (which the user only needs to install if using the source code, instead of the provided executable versions). An overview of the used libraries/modules is given next:

- [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html), for generating the Graphical User Interface, with all its capabilities
- [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html), for parsing CSV files
- [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html), for using some specific methods of the Python interpreter
- [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html), for using some capabilities of the Operating System directly from the Python program
- [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html), for running command line arguments using the Python program
- [webbrowser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html), for opening webpages from the GUI
- [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html), for making operations using regular expressions

# How to use the sdtDBN GUI program?

The sdtDBNs GUI is composed by 7 tabs, each with its specific function in order to use the sdtDBNs capabilities. The general workflow of the sdtDBNs GUI using the developed tabs is the following.

1. To learn the sdtDBN, the user can use either the [first tab][1] or the [second tab][2]. The [first tab][1] should be used if the user wants to learn an sdtDBN from input files, whereas the [second tab][2] should be used if the user wants the retrieve an sdtDBN object already stored in a file.

2. After learning an sdtDBN, the user might desire to get a graphical representation of the sdtDBN, for which the [third tab][3] should be used.

3. To perform inference, some observations, for subjects/ids on which inference is to be made, must be given, which can be done in the [fourth tab][4].

4. After learning an sdtDBN and loading the observations for making inference, there are three inference modes the user can choose, each with in its specific tab:
   
   1. If the user wants to know the probability distribution of a specific attribute in a specific timestep given the data of a specific subject/id, the [fifth tab][5] should be used.
   
   2. If the user wants to, given the data of a specific subject/id, predict the progression of either all attributes or a specific attribute until a certain timestep, the [sixth tab][6] should be used.
   
   3. If the user wants to make predictions for several subjects/ids, the [seventh tab][7] should be used.

Given the general workflow described, the usage of each tab is described next.

# Website description 

This website contains explains how to use the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the sdtDBN program.

# sdtDBN program

sdtDBN is a program developed to learn Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) with both static and dynamic features/attribues, allowing the user to make inference on the learned DBNs. All background related to sdtDBNs can be checked in the sdtDBN website, available at [https://ttlion.github.io/sdtDBN/](https://ttlion.github.io/sdtDBN/). The GUI presented in this website is an interface for a user to be able to use the sdtDBN program capabilities in a graphical way.

# Current releases and libraries

## Current releases

The GUI was developed using Python, being all source files available [here](sources_sdtDBNsGUI.zip), with the respective Github repository available [here](https://github.com/ttlion/sdtDBNsGUI_code).

For a user to be able to run the program without having to resort to the Python programming language, there are available executable standalone versions of the program, for Windows and for Linux, both in version 0.0.1: 

- [Windows executable v.0.0.1](sdtDBN_GUI_windows.zip)
- [Linux executable v.0.0.1](sdtDBN_GUI_Linux.zip)

## External libraries

To generate images for the sdtDBNs, the GUI uses the DOT language. Therefore, if the user wants to use the GUI to create graphical representations of the created sdtDBNs (more details [here](#how-to-use-the-sdtdbn-gui-program)), Graphviz must be installed in the proper Operating System. Check [here](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) for more details on how to install Graphviz.

The program, written in Python, uses several Python libraries/modules (which the user only needs to install if using the source code, instead of the provided executable versions). An overview of the used libraries/modules is given next:

- [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html), for generating the Graphical User Interface, with all its capabilities
- [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html), for parsing CSV files
- [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html), for using some specific methods of the Python interpreter
- [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html), for using some capabilities of the Operating System directly from the Python program
- [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html), for running command line arguments using the Python program
- [webbrowser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html), for opening webpages from the GUI
- [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html), for making operations using regular expressions
